# Loan_EMI_Python_Project
The Python project, titled "EMI Calculator," has been developed to offer a glimpse into the 
monthly and yearly EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) calculations based on user-provided data.
While a few examples have been included in the context to illustrate the functionality of the
project, it is designed to work seamlessly with any user-provided data, as it is dynamic in nature.
